[There is a Demo video which displays the gameplay. Check it out!]

Rule: 
     
     Player can choose one of the difficulty to start the game. The volume slider can adjust the BGM volume.
     Player can use the mouse to click on the objects for some points.
     Bottles, cookies and fishes give you positive scores, while the bomb will decrease it.
     When there is 1 object fall down to the bottom of the screen before the player clicked on it, player lives will be decreased by 1.
     However, the bomb will not be counted for lossing lives when it fall down to the screen.
     When the player lives reaches 0, the game is over.
     Click the restart button to restart the game.

Future work:

     1. Pause the game and have a pause menu
     2. Swipe function to make the mouse destroy the objects except for just click it
